# BigFractions
This project creates a new user-defined type for doing arithmetic on Rational numbers, or in other terms, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions. Rather than using int or long as our underlying primitive data type, this project will use BigInteger which is a little cumbersome, but allows exact arithmetic (i.e. no overflows). The Fraction class inherits from (i.e. extends) the Number Java class.
